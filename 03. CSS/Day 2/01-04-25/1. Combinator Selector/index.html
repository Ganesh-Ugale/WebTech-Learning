<!-- NOTES:
1. Hackon Vion Lei introduced CSS 

2. 2. Combinator Selectors 
      i) Genaral sibling Selectors
      ii) Adjecent sibling Selectors
      iii) Child Selectors
      iv) Descendant Selector
      
3. Siblings Means on Same Level element
    i)  Genaral sibling Selectors
    Ex:
       <div>
        <h1></h1>
       </div>
        <p></p>
        <h2></h2>
        here the div, p,h2 is a Genaral sibling Selectors

        CSS EX:
        div ~ h2{   that means these are siblings but not adjecent so use this sign ~ i.e these are siblings but not adjecent
        }

        that means the h2 is targeted

4. ii) Adjecent Siblings means one after another
       Ex: 
        <p></p>
        <h2></h2>
        <h3></h3>

        here the p,and h2 only are Adjecent sibling Selectors OR h2 and h3 are the .

        CSS EX:

        i.e p + h2{   they are side by side means adjecent   means h2 is targeted only
        }

        OR   

        h2 + h3{  that means h3 is targeted only
        }

5. In gendral Sibling selectors and Adjecent Sibling Selectors the last one sibling is targeted
    Ex:

    }

    h3+p~div{
    here only div is targeted
    }

       h2
       h3
       h3
