<!-- NOTES: Media Queries
 1. used to achive an responsive design OR Layout.
 2. to make a responsive for to make the webpage responsive accoirding to all diveces screen
 3. relative units and media queries are used to make the responsive layout
 4. if we design the webpage for the desktop and make it responsive for the mobile then only once we write an code for once in media quesries.
 5. that means where we need a change when the size of screen is this or this.
 6. If we need our website is design for the each and every device like desktop, laptop, phone, tab so we need to write an media querirs for each device
 7. we write media queries in css using @media word

 8.  Ex: @media screen and (max-width = 1000px){
    .enq{  // this is an class name of that ele 
        display: none;
    }

    i.e when the screen reaches the 1000px then enqiry tab  goes hide.
