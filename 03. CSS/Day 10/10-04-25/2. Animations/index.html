<!-- NOTES: Animations
 1.To Understand the Animations we need to understand transform and tarnsition properties:
 
2.  transfrom: rotate(360deg);
    tansition-duration: 10s;
    
     the div rotate in360 deg in 10s.
     
3. transform: scale(1.5) ==> scale means to change how many times the current time scale up Or Scale down
   transition-duration: 10s;
   
   that means the div is increase thiere size in 10 sec slowly.
   - scale 0 means no any dimentions no width no any so it collapse

4. transform: skew() ==> the element becomes tilted means beech mese mod jana + and - directions oposite
    transition-duration: 2s;

5.  transform: translate(100px) ===> one object move to another place here 100px that objject will move to there current poition
     transition-duration: 2s;

     we can give - or + menas left and right
     we can also move up and down using axis translate(0px -300px) means x-axis 0 and negative y axis in css is upside

######################### ANIMATIONS ###################################
1. to create an animation use @keyframes indentifierName{} and after compplete give this block name to animation-name: identiferName(); in this property.
2. Ex:
    @keyframes abc{
        from{
            div la apan sangnar starting la tu kasa hotas
        }
        to{
         div la apan sangnar ending la tu kasa honar kivva zalas
        }

         i.e like a if and else statement
    }
    NOTE: from{} block==>  this block is optional bvcz we had already written its property in css
    NOTE: animation names se jitni bhi property he vo haam kabhi bhi  @keyframes me kahi bhi nahi likhega.
